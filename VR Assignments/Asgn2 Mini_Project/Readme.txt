This is the mini-project of VR course.

It simulates the VR scene of Shenzhou aircraft about launching, cruising and jointing. The models of shenzhou aircrafts are builded under blender by my teammates Hu Xiaowei and Wang Xi. The animation of this project is project is simulated under unity by me. 

This program has seven different camera views controlled by key number 1-7 respectively. The Ctrl key is used as control button to send out all the commands including launching, cruising to the equator and preparing the jointing.

The program is compiled under Mac OS. You could download the “Shenzhou Joint Simulation.zip” and play it after your unzipping the file.
